Anny-Claude Joseph,aj106@wellesley.edu,"Assistant Professor of Mathematics Biostatistician interested in topics at the intersection of health and place, statistics pedagogy, and data ethics. Broadly, my research is focused on the relationship between place-where we live, learn, and work -and health/social outcomes. Much of my ongoing research work involves using Bayesian statistical methods to investigate the relationship between historic redlining and contemporary asthma prevalence in major cities in the United States. My past work has centered on using spatial epidemiological approaches to assess the impact of incorporating residential histories into the analysis of cancer risk. Over the years I have had the privilege of teaching mathematics and statistics courses at various levels. Regardless of the course, my overarching objective is to develop sophisticated consumers of quantitative research who are well-equipped to use data to investigate self-generated research questions of interest in an ethical and responsible manner. Outside of the classroom, I am interested in mentoring students who are interested in facilitating K-12 outreach programs and pathway building STEM workshops for minority groups. STAT218 This is a calculus-based introductory statistics course. Topics covered include data collection, data visualization, descriptive statistics, linear regression, sampling schemes, design of experiment, probability, random variables (both discrete and continuous cases), Normal model, statistical tests and inference (e.g. one-sample and two-sample z-tests and t-tests, chi-square test, etc). Statistical language R will be used throughout the course to realize data visualization, linear regression, simulations, and statistical tests and inference. STAT219 Wellesley College"
Eni Mustafaraj,emustafa@wellesley.edu,"Associate Professor of Computer Science I love data, the Web, and web data. I aim to understand, critique, and transform web-based sociotechnical systems using data & web science. I am a computational data scientist who studies the online information environment shaped by the interactions of algorithms, humans, and organizations. I typically focus on one web-based sociotechnical system at a time. I have studied Twitter, Google, Wikipedia, and YouTube. Since November 2023, I have turned my focus to TikTok. Students in my research lab, Wellesley Cred Lab, and in my 300-level course, CS 315 Data Science for the Web, are building tools to audit TikTok’s recommendation algorithm and study the flow of information in this platform. I love collaborations! Since my arrival at Wellesley in 2008, I have had many long and rewarding research collaborations. During 2008-2014, I collaborated withProf. Takis Metaxas, Samantha Finn ‘12 and a large number of Wellesley students in studying how rumors or other kinds of information spread in social networks like Twitter. From 2013-2017 I collaborated withProf. Franklyn Turbak, Maja Svanberg ‘18, and Isabelle Li '20 on using data science and machine learning to understand how people learn to program in the MIT App Inventor online platform. Since 2015 I have been collaborating with Prof. Julie Walsh (Philosophy) on ways of integrating ethics of technology in our computer science and data science curriculum. Most recently, wereceived a grant from the NSFto support our work. As part of our project, we are co-teaching a cross-listed CS/PHIL course on Methods for Ethics of Technology and have started LEED (Laboratory on Ethics and Equity in Digital tech). Collaborating with other Wellesley faculty, I have co-founded theData Science major;the Wellesley CAPS (Computational Analysis for Political Science) Lab withProf. Maneesh Arora, and the Wellesley CHEL (Computational Housing Economics Lab) withProf. Kyung Park. I am particularly proud of the students of my research lab, the Wellesley Cred Lab. Many of the lab alums, with whom I have co-authored research papers while they were undergraduate students are excelling in graduate school, Emma Lurie ‘19, Khonzoda Umarova ‘20, Annabel Rothschild ‘20, Anna Kawakami ‘21, Junita Sirait ‘22. Mentoring undergraduate students is one of the main joys of my work at Wellesley and I have been fortunate to receive theNSF CAREER awardto support this kind of research-focused teaching and mentoring. Other courses I teach are CS111 Computer Programming and Problem Solving, one of the most fun and challenging intro courses at Wellesley, and two data science related courses: CS 234 Data, Analytics, and Visualization and CS 315 Data Science for the Web, in which my students work on real-world projects closely related to my research and learn how to use data science to make a social impact. I love listening to podcasts and audiobooks. Some of my favorite living authors are Kazuo Ishiguro, Neal Stephenson, Rachel Cusk, and Elif Batuman. I like both speculative/science fiction (Ishiguro, Stephenson, etc.) and fictionalized memoirs (Cusk, Batuman, etc.). Last updated on February 2024. CS111 An introduction to problem-solving through computer programming. Students learn how to read, modify, design, debug, and test algorithms that solve problems. Programming concepts include control structures, data structures, abstraction, recursion, and modularity. Students explore these concepts in the context of interactive programs, data processing, and graphics or audio, using the Python programming language.Students are required to attend an additional two-hour laboratory section each week.  [Registration as of Tuesday, September 3]This course is currently full and the Workday waitlist is closed. If a spot becomes available during the add period a student from the (now closed) waitlist will be contacted by course faculty and allowed to register by permission of instructor (POI). Students on the Fall 2024 waitlist will be given priority status for initial Spring 2025 registration; note that this priority does not guarantee a seat in the class.

Cassandra Pattanayak,cpattana@wellesley.edu,"Jack and Sandra Polk Guthman '65 Director, Quantitative Analysis Institute, & Senior Lecturer in Quantitative Reasoning and Mathematics Statistician specializing in causal inference; creating the Quantitative Analysis Institute, to expand the role of statistics at Wellesley. My research focuses on causal inference, with applications to education, law, and health. Two phenomena may be correlated, but how can we design a study to address whether one causes the other? In particular, I develop tools that allow rigorous causal inference for applied projects that are complicated by practical constraints. I have worked on diagnostics for covariate balance in non-randomized studies, methods for addressing chance imbalances in randomized experiments, and a Bayesian approach for analyzing outcomes from propensity score subclassified designs. My applied work has included measuring the impact of offering free legal assistance to indigent clients and developing best practices for in vitro fertilization. I am also interested in statistics education and course design. As Guthman Director of the Quantitative Analysis Institute, my goal is to expand the role of statistics in both research and teaching at Wellesley. I collaborate with faculty and student researchers from a variety of fields, provide and coordinate statistical consulting, and run workshops for faculty and students. I believe that students should master fundamental statistical ideas that generalize across disciplines, along with the practical skills necessary to use this knowledge. I teach the Quantitative Analysis Institute Summer Course, designed to introduce advanced statistical skills and support students in their current and future research projects. I also teach a First Year Seminar focused on causal inference, and I look forward to developing additional courses. I enjoy playing the trombone in Boston-area orchestras, exploring farmers’ markets, and spending time with my husband. QR260 This is an intermediate statistics course focused on fundamentals of statistical inference and applied data analysis tools. Emphasis on thinking statistically, evaluating assumptions, and developing practical skills for real-life applications to fields such as medicine, politics, education, and beyond. Topics include t-tests and non-parametric alternatives, multiple comparisons, analysis of variance, linear regression, model refinement and missing data. Students can expect to gain a working knowledge of the statistical software R, which will be used for data analysis and for simulations designed to strengthen conceptual understanding. This course can be counted as a 200-level course toward the major or minor in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Environmental Studies, Psychology or Neuroscience. Students who earned a Quantitative Analysis Institute Certificate are not eligible for this course. DS340H QR260 Wellesley College"
Qing (Wendy) Wang,qwang@wellesley.edu,"Associate Professor of Mathematics Statistician specializing in topics of U-statistics, nonparametric kernel density estimation, risk estimation, variance estimation, cross-validation, resampling schemes, and extrapolation/interpolation methods. I was born and raised in Beijing, China. I came to the U.S. to pursue a graduate degree in 2007, and received a Ph.D. in Statistics from Penn State University in 2012 under the supervision of the late Dr. Bruce G. Lindsay. Prior to joining Wellesley, I was a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Statistics at Williams College from 2012 to 2015, and at Bentley University from 2015 to 2016. My research focus on topics in U-statistics, risk estimation, variance estimation, and cross-validation. Some of my recent research interests also include penalization methods, model assessment tools, mediation analysis and jackknife empirical likelihood. My teaching considers both applied and theoretical topics in statistics, including introductory statistics, regression analysis, probability, multivariate data analysis, nonparametric statistics, and Bayesian statistics. I greatly enjoy working with students on research topics in statistics. I also have great passion in undergraduate statistics education, and I am interested in incorporating active learning and creating interactive and hands-on educational tools for teaching statistics. I am one of the advisors for the new data science major at Wellesley. To learn more about the data science major requirements, please visitthis website. (Note that effective Fall 2023, data science is no longer a structured individual major, but a regular major. Please refer to the data science website for the current DS major requirements.)

Jeremy Wilmer,jwilmer@wellesley.edu,"Professor of Psychology My research probes the individual human mind and establishes and disseminates best-practices in visual data communication. PSYC328 Why do some people have a keen memory for names or faces, a great sense of direction, or a remarkable ability to do two things at once? And why are some people only average (or even below average) in these areas? We will critically evaluate a broad range of perceptual and cognitive abilities (and disabilities) by drawing upon the fields of cognitive neuroscience, behavioral genetics, development, and human variation. We will address three kinds of questions: What broad combination of nature and nurture, and what specific genes and experiences, contribute to differing abilities? What are the neural and cognitive bases of such abilities? And how can we or should we apply such knowledge to ourselves, our families, our communities, and our countries? PSYC218 Wellesley College"
