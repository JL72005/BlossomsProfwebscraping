Carolyn Anderson,ca101@wellesley.edu,"Assistant Professor of Computer Science I use computational, experimental, and symbolic methods to understand meaning in natural language. My research focuses on understanding how context-sensitive meaning is encoded in natural language. I study words whose meanings change depending on who is using them, and when and where they are used. I build computational models to understand how conversation participants use knowledge about each other's mental states. How do speakers think about their audience when deciding what to say? How do listeners use their knowledge of the speaker when figuring out the meaning of their utterances? These aspects of language are among the most difficult for artificial intelligence to grasp, because they are situational, grounded, and interactive. In order to develop language technology that interacts with us in a natural way, we need to develop models that can adjust their language based on users' situations and knowledge states.

Scott Anderson,sanderso@wellesley.edu,"Senior Lecturer in Computer Science Professor Anderson's teaching interests include web application programming, including databases, web frameworks, and computer graphics. His research interests are similar, but also include artificial intelligence (particularly planning and natural language processing), simulation, system software and system administration. His courses cover simulation, computer graphics, and web-interfaced databases. CS304 CS 304 is a course in full-stack web development. The stack comprises the front-end (typically a web browser), the back-end (a database for storing and retrieving user-contributed data) and the middleware that knits the two together. We will learn how to parse the incoming web request, route the request to the appropriate handler, retrieve data from the database that is relevant to the user's search, combine that data with static templates of web pages, and deliver that data to the browser. We will build endpoints to handle Ajax requests and learn about REST APIs.We will also discuss performance, reliability,concurrency, and security issues. In a semester project, we will create dynamic websites driven by database entries. In the fall, the CS 304 stack will comprise Flask and MySQL. In the spring, the CS 304 stack will comprise Node.js and MongoDB. CS204 Wellesley College"
Christine Bassem,cbassem@wellesley.edu,"Anchor Point Assistant Professor in Computer Science My broad research interests are in mechanism and algorithm design for dynamic distributed systems, including crowd networks, mobile ad-hoc networks, and transport networks.  See my personal website: https://cs.wellesley.edu/~cbassem/ CS242 A systems-oriented approach to data networks, including a theoretical discussion of common networking problems and an examination of modern networks and protocols.

Brian Brubach,bb100@wellesley.edu,"Assistant Professor of Computer Science I love designing algorithms and exploring CS theory applied to e-commerce, fairness in machine learning, democracy, and bioinformatics. I have broad research interests in algorithms and theoretical computer science motivated by a range of social good applications. On the theoretical side, much of my work falls into the categories of approximation algorithms, online algorithms, randomized algorithms, data-driven algorithms, and combinatorial optimization. This means I’m often looking for the best possible solution to problems we don’t expect to be able to solve optimally. My favorite problems to study usually involve some combination of matching, clustering, strings, and uncertainty (e.g., stochastic matching). On the applied side, I draw on problems from e-commerce, fairness in machine learning and automated systems, mechanism design for social good, the U.S. electoral system, and genomics/metagenomics. In the future, I hope to develop more interdisciplinary collaborations and strengthen the connections between theory and practice in my work. I’m excited to teach a number of core computer science courses at Wellesley and some new electives. I’ve taught CS 115 Computing for the Socio-Techno Web and CS 231 Fundamental Algorithms so far. My favorite thing about CS 115 is teaching coding within the context of its social implications at a time when our society is reckoning with the consequences of computer technology. CS 231 is central to my research and was one of the most important courses I’ve taken as a student (with two B.A.s!). So it’s wonderful to share that material with others. In the future, I’m looking forward to teaching other introductory courses and more advanced algorithms electives. My other professional interests include service, mentorship, and community building. Throughout all of my work, I’m devoted to promoting diversity and inclusion in computer science. Before studying computer science, I was a freelance filmmaker and non-profit educator. As a teaching artist, I had the opportunity to work with amazing students, parents, teachers, and artists in several Chicago public schools. Outside of computer science, I love spending time with my family, designing and playing board games, listening to music and podcasts, watching movies, biking, hiking, and cooking/eating vegetarian food.

Vinitha Gadiraju,vg101@wellesley.edu,"Assistant Professor of Computer Science I am an interdisciplinary researcher who studies the design of accessible, assistive, and inclusive technologies. My research centers on building collaborative, equitable tools for people with disabilities, particularly in the context of learning and education. I have also started to research large language models and how generative artificial intelligence can represent and be designed by people from historically marginalized groups. I am passionate about collaborating with users from these groups to empower them in technology development. I approach my work through prototyping and qualitative research methods, including ethnography, co-design, user evaluation, interviews, and diary studies. I am teaching introductory programming, human-computer interaction, and plan to develop courses on accessibility and in-depth qualitative methodology and participatory design in computer science. I believe in teaching computer and information science through an ethical, socio-political lens that encourages students to analyze the broader impact of technology creation and aim for net social good by creating equitable tools. Outside of my job, I hope to support students in the Boston-area computer science community through growth and networking opportunities. I also aim to connect with and support multicultural groups on campus, particularly students from first and second generation immigrant backgrounds! I enjoy reading fiction, trying new restaurants, hiking, thrifting, and doing silly little arts and crafts. CS325 As technology increasingly integrates with our lives, how can we ensure that its design is inclusive of users' different abilities? CS 325 expands on the fundamentals of design and qualitative research to explore how technology can be made accessible for diverse users, with an emphasis on people with disabilities. In this course, we will read about and analyze approaches to inclusive technology, study how design intersects with disability justice, learn about the history of accessible and assistive technologies, understand how to create multimodal user experiences, learn accessible web programming, and test state-of-the-art tools. Students will also conduct a semester-long case study project in which they work in groups to identify accessibility issues on the Wellesley campus and work with the community to build appropriate technology solutions.

Catherine Grevet Delcourt,cdelcour@wellesley.edu,"Assistant Professor of Computer Science I build social systems prototypes and study how people relate to each other through social technologies. My research interests are varied in the areas of Human-Computer Interaction and Social Computing. I have studied the role of social media in political polarization, identity and anonymity in online conversations, novel prototyping methods for social systems research, personal information management, and personal informatics. I'm excited to teach introductory CS and MAS courses, web technologies, Human-Computer Interaction, and Social Computing topics. I most recently worked at Yik Yak, a college-based hyperlocal anonymous social networking app, and I like to include examples of industry design and development processes as part of my research and teaching.  CS230X An introduction to techniques and building blocks for organizing large programs. Topics include: modules, abstract data types, recursion, algorithmic efficiency, and the use and implementation of standard data structures and algorithms, such as lists, trees, graphs, stacks, queues, priority queues, tables, sorting, and searching. Students become familiar with these concepts through weekly programming assignments using the Java programming language.  CS230X is intended for students with significant prior experience in Java programming as demonstrated by a 5 in CS AP A, or equivalent demonstration of experience. Students in this section will complete self-directed weekly labs.

Sohie Lee,slee@wellesley.edu,"Senior Instructor in Computer Science Laboratory Interested in the intersection of cognitive science and computer science as well as the development of introductory computer science curriculum. My research background is in cognitive science. I'm fascinated with how the brain works and how computational models, along with neurophysiological data, can facilitate understanding of how things such as short-term memory work. I'm also interested in how best to teach computer science at the introductory level and how to promote CS, especially among female students. I teach mainly introductory lab courses. These are the hands-on classes where students actually write code to solve problems. A typical problem might be to write Javascript to validate a form in a webpage (CS110), or to write Java code to perform image manipulations such as rotation or crop (CS111), or to write MATLAB code to display an MRI slice of brain data from a particular viewpoint (CS112), or to write Java code to create a graphical user interface (GUI) to allow the user to access a database and sort and select data by certain criteria (CS230). My most recent honors thesis student examined the influence of the programming environment─a graphical drag-and-drop setup versus typing text into an editor window─upon retention of programming knowledge.

Peter Mawhorter,pmawhort@wellesley.edu,"Instructor in Computer Science Laboratory I'm a computer scientist interested in artificial intelligence and creativity, with a soft spot for interactive narrative and games. I do research using both modern and old-fashioned AI techniques that attempts to mimic, measure, and inspire human creativity. Where possible, I like to use this research as a vehicle for learning more about human aesthetic experiences. One concrete example of this is using logic programming to advance understanding of choice poetics via generated narrative choices. I'm interested in teaching basic computing skills to a broad audience, and I'd like to see a world where programming is an activity that everyone feels comfortable doing. I'm especially interested in teaching programming basics to scientists who need them for their experiments, and to humanists who want to sharpen their understanding of our increasingly code-driven world. I'm interested in open-access publishing and other publishing models that make science more accessible, and I'm looking out for ways that the potential of current telecommunications technology can be harnessed to better share research and stimulate discussions. In my spare time, I like to create wire sculptures. More info can be found at:http://cs.wellesley.edu/~pmwh/ Wellesley College"
Sara Melnick,sm141@wellesley.edu,"Instructor in Computer Science Laboratory I'm a computer scientist interested in broadening participation in computing, as well as accessibility and inclusion more broadly. I also love to nerd out about math and linguistics. I am interested in curricular development and pedagogy especially at the introductory level. I have taught computing (and STEM more generally) at both secondary and post-secondary levels with students from a variety of backgrounds, skill levels, and support needs. I am excited to learn from the work of others and build on it. I especially enjoy teaching introductory courses as it gives me an opportunity to help students new to the field discover where their passions lie. My favorite part of teaching is sitting with a student and helping them work through a problem or topic that has been stumping them. I am interested in historical linguistics and discrete math. I am actively involved in the SIGCSE community. I enjoy knitting, math and logic puzzles, board games, and reading young adult literature (especially fantasy). Wellesley College"
Panagiotis Metaxas,pmetaxas@wellesley.edu,"Professor of Computer Science Engaged in research on Web Science, Web Spam and Information Retrieval, Medical s/w, Parallel Computing, Multimedia, and CS Education. My research interests are currently in Web Science, Web spam and information retrieval and cognitive hacking. In particular, I am interested in how the Web is changing the way we think, decide and act as individuals and members of social communities. Web Science, as this new and exciting area is currently known, is interdisciplinary, connecting Computer Science to Social Sciences (esp. Sociology, Political Science, Psychology, Economics) and Natural Sciences (esp. Biology). My recent work on evaluating the quality of web search results and the relationship between web spam and social propaganda has been recognized with three Best Paper Awards (2008, 2009, 2010). I have also published extensively in the areas of parallel computing, multimedia, algorithm visualization, and computer science education. I hold a U.S. patent on parallel dithering (halftoning) techniques that can lead to faster printers and large screen monitors. Teaching has always been a passion of my life. I have taught and developed courses for all curricular levels. In particular, I have developed an award-winning intermediate course entitled ""Multimedia Design and Programming"" that became the core of the Media Arts and Science Program, supported through the collaboration of the CS and Art Departments. I have also developed two advanced courses; ""Parallel Machines and their Algorithms"" and ""Web Search and Mining"". More recently, I developed an award-winning introductory course entitled ""The Socio-Techno Web: Technologies for Communication"" about the perils and opportunities in Cyberspace. In all of my courses I bring the experience from my academic and professional life and apply pedagogical techniques that help students monitor their learning progress. One of the teaching aspects that I enjoy most is helping my honors thesis students do research and write strong theses that will prepare them in their academic and professional careers. I am a Senior Member of the ACM, the primary professional organization of Computer Scientists, and a Member of Liberal Arts Computer Science (LACS) Consortium, IEEE Computer Society, SIGWEB, SIGCSE and SIGACT's electronic publication board. I serve on several conference Program Committees and am the representative of the Computing Research Association (CRA). In the past I have been a visiting scientist at MIT and at the Sydney University, Australia. Being interested in the applications of Computing, I worked as the Chief Technology Officer of a biotech company specializing in computerized tests for measuring the symptoms of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD). Currently, I am a Research Associate at the Developmental Biopsychiatry Research Program at McLean Hospital. In my free time I like to ""do"" soccer: play, coach my daughters' teams, referee games. I also enjoy reading French comics, especially of my alter ego, Corto Maltese. And some friends have figured out that one of the reasons I am in Academia is so that I have lots of opportunities to travel.

Eni Mustafaraj,emustafa@wellesley.edu,"Associate Professor of Computer Science I love data, the Web, and web data. I aim to understand, critique, and transform web-based sociotechnical systems using data & web science. I am a computational data scientist who studies the online information environment shaped by the interactions of algorithms, humans, and organizations. I typically focus on one web-based sociotechnical system at a time. I have studied Twitter, Google, Wikipedia, and YouTube. Since November 2023, I have turned my focus to TikTok. Students in my research lab, Wellesley Cred Lab, and in my 300-level course, CS 315 Data Science for the Web, are building tools to audit TikTok’s recommendation algorithm and study the flow of information in this platform. I love collaborations! Since my arrival at Wellesley in 2008, I have had many long and rewarding research collaborations. During 2008-2014, I collaborated withProf. Takis Metaxas, Samantha Finn ‘12 and a large number of Wellesley students in studying how rumors or other kinds of information spread in social networks like Twitter. From 2013-2017 I collaborated withProf. Franklyn Turbak, Maja Svanberg ‘18, and Isabelle Li '20 on using data science and machine learning to understand how people learn to program in the MIT App Inventor online platform. Since 2015 I have been collaborating with Prof. Julie Walsh (Philosophy) on ways of integrating ethics of technology in our computer science and data science curriculum. Most recently, wereceived a grant from the NSFto support our work. As part of our project, we are co-teaching a cross-listed CS/PHIL course on Methods for Ethics of Technology and have started LEED (Laboratory on Ethics and Equity in Digital tech). Collaborating with other Wellesley faculty, I have co-founded theData Science major;the Wellesley CAPS (Computational Analysis for Political Science) Lab withProf. Maneesh Arora, and the Wellesley CHEL (Computational Housing Economics Lab) withProf. Kyung Park. I am particularly proud of the students of my research lab, the Wellesley Cred Lab. Many of the lab alums, with whom I have co-authored research papers while they were undergraduate students are excelling in graduate school, Emma Lurie ‘19, Khonzoda Umarova ‘20, Annabel Rothschild ‘20, Anna Kawakami ‘21, Junita Sirait ‘22. Mentoring undergraduate students is one of the main joys of my work at Wellesley and I have been fortunate to receive theNSF CAREER awardto support this kind of research-focused teaching and mentoring. Other courses I teach are CS111 Computer Programming and Problem Solving, one of the most fun and challenging intro courses at Wellesley, and two data science related courses: CS 234 Data, Analytics, and Visualization and CS 315 Data Science for the Web, in which my students work on real-world projects closely related to my research and learn how to use data science to make a social impact. I love listening to podcasts and audiobooks. Some of my favorite living authors are Kazuo Ishiguro, Neal Stephenson, Rachel Cusk, and Elif Batuman. I like both speculative/science fiction (Ishiguro, Stephenson, etc.) and fictionalized memoirs (Cusk, Batuman, etc.). Last updated on February 2024. CS111 An introduction to problem-solving through computer programming. Students learn how to read, modify, design, debug, and test algorithms that solve problems.
