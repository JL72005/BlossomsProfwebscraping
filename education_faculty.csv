Pamela D'Andrea Martínez,pd107@wellesley.edu,"Assistant Professor of Education Studies intersecting issues of race, immigration, language, and culture in schools and locates transformative education spaces/practices Pamela D’Andrea Martínez is an assistant professor of education with a research agenda focused on imagining and building anti-oppressive, humanizing, and culturally sustaining education school systems through three lines of inquiry: (1) redefining educational belonging with immigrant youth and Latinx youth; (2) exploring critical and cultural pedagogies; and (3) researching the complexities of race and other social markers at a school systems level. Her dissertation, ""Transnational and Immigrant Youth Belonging and Their Entryways to an Anti-Oppressive Education,"" was a critical ethnographic and collaborative study that captured the dynamics of race, language, culture, and immigration that youth who arrived in the U.S. as teenagers experienced in and out of school and utilized youth perspectives to challenge the existing bewilderment of schools over how to serve recently arrived youth. At Wellesley, D’Andrea Martínez teaches courses about issues of power in schools and locating the power of youth and schools to be socially transformative. She believes that learning is profoundly connected to being loved, building community, and doing work that matters and is accountable to communities beyond the walls of the College. As such, she co-constructs elements of each course with students to prepare them to take ownership of the essential work of equitable teaching, education policy, and education research. Before coming to Wellesley College, D’Andrea Martínez taught an urban education course at New York University and prior was a Florida public school teacher of high school World Languages and of elementary Dual Language Two-Way Immersion. In addition to research and teaching, D’Andrea Martinez enjoys working with grassroots organizers, youth, and educators on transformative education projects. As part of her work at the NYU Metropolitan Center for Research on Equity and the Transformation of Schools (NYU Metro Center), she designed and conducted professional learning workshops for in-service and pre-service teachers and school and district administrators on centering multilingual learners in school-wide and instructional culturally sustaining work. She remains a faculty affiliate of the NYU Metro Center for work in the areas of urban education, bilingual education, immigration, critical and cultural pedagogies, and other intersectional issues. EDUC245 The United States is multilingual. Since before colonization, many Indigenous languages circulated as well as the languages of the colonizers and the languages brought by enslaved Africans. Today, there is incredible linguistic fluidity and diversity across the country. However, linguistic pluralism in schools has traditionally only been extended to the elite, making language a battleground for anti-Immigration, anti-Indigeneity, and anti-Blackness. In this course, students will unpack the linguistic ideologies that have been operationalized in schools and what these have meant for the experiences of multilingual learners. Students will learn about the history of multilingualism in schools, its current political landscape, and how grassroots efforts have imagined and pushed for linguistic justice.

Soo Hong,shong@wellesley.edu,"Diane Silvers Ravitch ’60 Professor of Public Education and the Common Good & Professor of Education Explores school-community relationships in K-12 urban schools with an emphasis on race, immigration, and culture. I am a sociologist of education who studies the relationships between schools and families/communities, exploring the role of race, culture, social history, and political life. While we may typically view educational change through school-centered efforts, I explore the central role of families and communities in school transformation through models that emphasize parent leadership, community organizing and democratic forms of participation. My recently published book,Natural Allies: Hope and Possibility in Teacher-Family Partnerships(Harvard Education Press, 2019) explores the experiences of five urban teachers who have found innovative and authentic ways to engage their students' families and communities. The book features discussions of culture and community, the deep-rooted histories of the teacher-parent relationship and the necessity of confronting racism, distrust, and misunderstanding when partnership and collaboration is the goal. My 2011 book,A Cord of Three Strands: A New Approach to Family Engagement in Schools(Harvard Education Press, 2011) explored the role of community organizing efforts to transform public education in Chicago and demonstrates how these participatory models can reframe our conceptualization of parent engagement in schools. At Wellesley, I teach courses on youth and family studies, capstone seminars on urban education and immigration, as well as a first-year seminar that explores issues in K-12 education through an exploration of popular films and TV shows. I am also the director of the Wellesley Teacher Scholars program which supports students who are interested in classroom teaching. My own career in education began as an elementary and middle school teacher, so it feels special to be working with the next generation of teachers. Wellesley College"

Noah Rubin,nrubin@wellesley.edu,"Lecturer in Education Research on teacher education, urban education, teacher and youth participatory action research, and the unity of theory and practice in education. The heart of my work in education is an attempt to make the words of A. S. Neill, “THOU SHALT BE ON THE CHILD’S SIDE” a reality. My work has taken me from New York City, to Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE), and now here to Wellesley. I began my journey as an educator in New York City's Spanish Harlem, where I was a middle school teacher for 10 years. During that time I also worked as a cooperating teacher supervising student teachers from my alma mater, Bank Street College of Education. Through Bank Street and in East Harlem I became a passionate advocate for urban children and began my work on such areas as social and emotional learning, child and adolescent development, anti-bias education with an emphasis on LGBTQI issues, action research, and progressive and constructivist educational theory, practice, and history. I still have a special place in my heart for Spanish Harlem and urban children, teachers, and schools in general. At Harvard, and in my current research, I focus on indigenous school reform efforts including the enactment of Action Research by students and teachers. My recent writing has explored the ""art of action research pedagogy"" and the work teacher educators do to help teachers learn to carry out research in their own classrooms or schools. Over the last decade I spent a good deal of time working with new teachers in the Harvard Teacher Education program and for much of that time I also taught child and adolescent development at HGSE. One of my greatest joys is working to support the learning projects that students originate and pursue. I encourage students to visit me in office hours or to make appointments and am committed to making learning in my courses both inspiring and real. Because of this I work to include the voices of real students and teachers in most sessions and use texts, films, radio segments, documentaries, and fiction to draw as close to the realities of schooling as possible. Issues of social justice undergird my teaching and I try to keep an eye on both the innovation and joy in education, what McLaren calls the “Hope,” and the roadblocks and sadness, which we call the “Rage” (2006). In my Understanding and Improving Schools course (EDUC 215) I focus largely on schools that show us how profoundly joyful and rigorous learning can be. We also explore a whole range of innovations that have made the lives of those in schools better. My courses are full of usable pedagogical methods and I work to help student see themselves as teacher/students and student/teachers. As director of Elementary education, I work hard to make sure students have a deep experience with real children and schools. Developing the tools Wellesley elementary teachers need to be educational leaders and take joy in working with children are also vital areas of concern for me. I currently live with my wife and son in Jamaica Plain, Boston and lately spend a good deal of time learning about child development from my little boy. In my personal life, and spilling over into my professional attire, I have a thirty-five year devotion to the clothing of the 1930’s and can often be seen wearing a bowtie. EDUC201 We will study characteristics of young children with disabilities and examine supportive programs, practices, and services. We will focus on theoretical and applied knowledge about disabilities, including communication disorders, sensory impairments, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorders, autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disabilities, giftedness, and physical and health related disabilities. We will discuss screening, assessment, early intervention, individualized education programs, inclusive education, community resources, family issues, and the requirements of various state and federal laws that impact children and students with disabilities. Students will learn how programsmake accommodations, structure modifications, and differentiate instruction based on young children's needs. EDUC213 Wellesley College"
Diane Tutin,dtutin@wellesley.edu,"Senior Lecturer in Education Experienced educator with interests in children's literature, literacy learning, fostering communities of learners, and special education. My interests are in how children learn to read, write, and speak and how teachers learn to effectively teach them. As a classroom teacher for eighteen years, I taught both urban and suburban students. I was a teacher of children with emotional, behavioral, and learning differences as well as a teacher of first and third grade. I began my teaching career in an alternative school for boys with social and emotional challenges whose needs were not met in the Boston Public Schools. I worked in special education for seven years. During that time, I learned an enormous amount about individual learning styles, growth mindset, and the importance of connecting with students through strong connections with them, their families, and communities. I taught first and third grade in the Wellesley Public Schools for eleven years and completed my graduate studies in language and literacy. My association with Wellesley College began as a placement for student teachers. I became a member of the team that teaches the methods course for Elementary Education student teachers over fifteen years ago. I currently teach EDUC 310Child Literacy and the Teaching of Readingas well as EDUC 325Educating English Language Learners. I continue to participate frequently in professional institutes and workshops in the field of literacy. I am passionate about children’s literature and find great joy in helping students learn to teach literacy skills and strategies by anchoring them to quality and diverse children’s literature. I’m currently certified in Massachusetts to teach Elementary Education in grades 1-6, Moderate Special Needs from preschool to grade 9, and Reading in grades K-12. I’m a member of the International Literacy Association, the Massachusetts Reading Association, MATSOL - Massachusetts Teachers of English Learners, and Alpha Upsilon Alpha, the International Literacy Association's honor society. I am a wife as well as a mother to an adolescent daughter. I enjoy seeing the world through her eyes. Books are an important part of our home life. I enjoy talking about books and finding out what others are reading. I also love to sing. I am a soprano who has performed on stage in many musicals at regional, stock, and community theaters.

Barbara Beatty,bbeatty@wellesley.edu,"Professor Emerita of Education Historian of education and of childhood, teacher education, and education reform; preschool policy and advocacy After teaching kindergarten in the Boston Public Schools, directing a laboratory preschool, and studying developmental psychology, I became interested in the historical question of why the United States, unlike most developed countries, does not provide universal preschool education, the topic of my bookPreschool Education in America. I've also written about teachers, teacher education, and the relationship of psychology to education reform, particularly Jean Piaget's psychology and the fate of child-centered education. I do research on the history of childhood, as well, particularly on young, ""educationally disadvantaged"" children. All of these themes relate to attempts to increase social equity through education. I teach courses on the history of American education and on the history of childhood and child welfare. By closely examining documents from the past, I think we can learn a lot about how Americans fought over what education should be like, for which students, and why. We can also see how teachers struggled to deal with society's increasing demands for schools to solve social problems. By studying children's lives in the past we can try to get a sense of the gap between adults' prescriptions and policies and children's experiences and needs, and of how children are historical actors who create their own cultures. I've been an Associate Editor of History of Education Quarterly for more than ten years and am also active in the American Educational Research Association and the Society for the History of Children and Youth. I've worked with colleagues to edit books and journals on kindergartens, preschools, parenting, and child welfare. As an advocate for universal preschool education, I've participated in the national debate over preschool policy. As a teacher educator and member of the Consortium for Excellence in Teacher Education, the group of Ivy League and other selective colleges to which Wellesley belongs, I've worked for many years to raise the status of teaching as a profession. I think increased access to high quality preschool and teacher education and better support for teachers will go far to help close achievement gaps in American education. Wellesley College"
Ken Hawes,khawes@wellesley.edu,"Senior Lecturer Emeritus of Education Study of educational philosophy and practice, and the knowledge and values we hope to share. Before graduate school, I was a middle and high school teacher of math and science, most notably at Roxbury Latin School for five years. At Wellesley, I taught courses for those preparing for and doing their student teaching internships, andalso philosophy of education, in later years as a Writing Program course. I see education as a lifelong endeavor of each person and as a vital family and social function. It is a world-wide historical and contemporary story woven throughout history. Teaching and learning happen everywhere, and they call on all that we are. One aim of philosophy of education, as I see it, is to give us words and viewpoints that help us collaborate and communicate with others. In teaching, we need to communicate well not only with our own students and colleagues, but also withparents and the wider public, for education in its many forms weaves together society as a whole. A central challenge of democracy is the need to reason about education in ways that can be widely shared and understood. For many of us, college and the years after graduation are a time of personal and intellectual searching. At the same time there is always practical work to be done. I have found that teaching, as one example, can foster tremendous learning, especially when we can find opportunities for discussion, reading, and reflection, perhaps through journal writing. I like to think that part of this search is for an inclusive social outlook and sensibilities that can unite us sufficiently to live and work and govern ourselves together. Working with my students over the years has taught me so much about all of this. Since my retirement in July of 2023, I have been happy to see how my thought has been able to roam free and to integrate new views and interests, including some specifics about artificial intelligence and human minds and about the challenges ofglobal warming. In my personal life, I live closely with those who are experiencing memory loss and cognitive decline. I have been given the chance to consider dimensions of human experience that I was less aware of, and to grow as a person.One of the most rewarding parts of my life at Wellesley has been to work with many generations of students aspiring to be teachers. They taught me so much about how theory and practice and self-knowledge and relationships intertwine, and I amvery grateful to them. As I am also to my wonderful colleagues across the College.
